Probability and Statistics: An Introduction 
Chance is the only source of true novelty.  said Francis Crick 
Introduction Machine learning builds mathematical models from which the predictions are made by learn ing from data samples. The predictions are naturally probabilistic because the samples only provide an incomplete view of the entire data. There are several ways in which probability and statistics are used in machine learning: Probability and statistics are used to build probabilistic models in machine learning. For example, a data set may contain multiple properties of individuals, such as their age, salary, credit score, and so on. Can one model how the individualâ€™s credit score is predicted from other attributes? Probabilistic techniques are used to model these types of relationships and use them for prediction. 
 Various methods from probability and statistics are used to quantify the confidence level in the predictions of machine learning models. If the same model is run on different subsets of the data, one might arrive at different conclusions. Are the core conclusions artifacts of specific statistical quirks of a particular data sample, or can they be trusted to provide a consistent view across different samples? This is important because there are inherent limitations to data collection in the real world, and one must often make predictions using small data samples. 
In many cases, the data is best understood with the use of statistical summaries and visualization techniques. This type of exploration is often a precursor to more detailed analysis.
